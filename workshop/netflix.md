# Netflix 1.0 SCM

Did you know that Netflix started as an online DVD rental store, the first one in the world? Your goal is to create a supply-chain management app to manage store resources.

  1. As a user, I want to keep the data about discs, so I know their ID, movie title, director, duration and year of release.
  2. As a user, I want to store the data in CSV file, so they are always up-to-date.
  3. As a user, I want to see the list of discs in the library in a table, so I can check all their data.
  4. As a user, I want to mark if a disk was rent and unmark if it returned, so I know which discs are available and which are rent.
  5. As a user, I want to search by keyword, so I can see discs which I look for.
