# Module overview: Programming Basics with Python

In this module, we are going to cover the following topics. These are only the keywords now but you can check maybe you have already mastered some of the topics in previous studies. The list can also act as a checklist of what you have learned so far in this module and what you still need to master to be able to advance to the next module.


  * variables:
    * integers,
    * strings (slicing, replacing letters),
    * booleans,


  * lists:
    * create an empty list,
    * add element (at the end, at specific index),
    * replace element,
    * delete element (by value, by index),
    * display element by index,
    * display elements without brackets,
    * operations on lists (sorting, reversing, length),


  * conditional instruction:
    * if/else statement,
    * condition,
    * difference between if and elif


  * operators:
    * assigning,
    * comparing,
    * grater than / less than
    * negation,
    * conjuction,
    * disconjuction,


  * loops:
    * while,
    * for index in range(),
    * for element in collection,


  * file handling:
    * open and close
    * read and write
    * create a list with strings from file
    * strip
    * slip


  * functions (in theory):
    * define a new function,
