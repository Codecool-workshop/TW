# Tic-tac-toe Game

### Description
Did you know an early variation of tic-tac-toe was already played in the Roman Empire, around the first century BC? It was called _terni lapilli_ (three pebbles at a time). Your goal is to create more modern version this popular game - with artificial intelligence!

### Requirements:

  2. The application randomly chooses a first player (a human player or a computer player).
  3. The first player uses an "X" sign, the second player uses an "O" sign.
  4. Each player can put a sign only at an empty spot.

 Good luck and have fun! :)
